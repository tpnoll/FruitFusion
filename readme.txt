How to Play
////////////

Left click anywhere on the blue center collumn to spawn your first fruit. 
You will see a preview of the fruit you are about to place on the left hand side of the screen under the title.
When two fruits of the same type collide, they will merge to form a larger fruit and your score at the bottom will increase.
You can spend your score points to purchase special items in the shop at the right side of the screen.
Your goal is to combine fruits to collect as many watermelons as possible (indicated in the bottom left). 
When you combine two watermelons, they will loop back to the smallest fruit so you can continue to collect more.
Be careful, however, if you stack fruit above the red line you will lose and the game will reset.
